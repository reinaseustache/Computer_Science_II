### Project 5
* SFacebook.java
* Friend.java
* FriendList.java
* FriendNotFoundException.java
* Proj5App.java
* fBData.txt (Sample input)

This program reads a sequence of command from an fBData file and calls methods from the SFacebook class in order to mimic a simple version of Facebook. If a P is read from the data file, a new Friend is added to the SFacebook, F makes two people friends, U unfriends two people, L lists a person's friends, Q checks whether two people are friends, V lists a person's friends and maybe their friends depending on security level and X terminates the program.
